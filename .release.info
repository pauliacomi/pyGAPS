# This file contains details about how to
# perform a release of pygaps (mostly for me).

# Create new branch for release (we use git flow)
# Versioning is provided automatically
# by setuptools_scm
# Respect semantic versioning for the releases
git flow release start x.y.z

# Ensure all tests are passing
# or use CI provider to run them automatically
pytest --cov --cov-report xml:coverage.xml

# Finish branch
git flow release finish x.y.z

# Push tags
git push --tags

# Check CI if project has been successfully pushed to pypi


# Useful for VSCode debugging
