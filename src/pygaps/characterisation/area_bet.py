    Calculate BET area from an isotherm.

    The optional ``p_limits`` parameter allows to specify the upper and lower
    pressure limits to calculate the BET area, otherwise the limits will be
    automatically selected based on the Rouquerol rules.

    Parameters
    ----------
    isotherm : PointIsotherm, ModelIsotherm
        The isotherm of which to calculate the BET surface area.
    branch : {'ads', 'des'}, optional
        Branch of the isotherm to use. It defaults to adsorption.
    p_limits : tuple[float, float], optional
        Pressure range in which to perform the calculation.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Prints extra information and plots graphs of the calculation.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary of results with the following components. The basis of these
        results will be derived from the basis of the isotherm (per mass, per
        volume, or per mole of adsorbent):

        - ``area`` (float) : calculated BET surface area, in m2/unit of adsorbent
        - ``c_const`` (float) : the C constant in the BET equation, unitless
        - ``n_monolayer`` (float) : the amount adsorbed at statistical monolayer, in mmol
        - ``p_monolayer`` (float) : the pressure at which statistical monolayer is chosen, relative
        - ``bet_slope`` (float) : slope of the BET plot
        - ``bet_intercept`` (float) : intercept of the BET plot
        - ``corr_coef`` (float) : correlation coefficient of the linear region in the BET plot

    Raises
    ------
    ParameterError
        When something is wrong with the function parameters.
    CalculationError
        When the calculation itself fails.

    Notes

    *Description*

    The BET method [#]_ is one of the first standardised methods to calculate the
    surface area of a porous material. It is generally applied on isotherms obtained
    through N2 adsorption at 77K, although other adsorbates (Ar, Kr) have been used.

    It assumes that the adsorption happens on the surface of the material in
    incremental layers according to the BET theory. Even if the adsorbent is mesoporous,
    the initial amount adsorbed (usually between 0.05 - 0.4 :math:`p/p_0`) can be
    modelled through the BET equation:

    .. math::

        \frac{p/p_0}{n_{ads} (1-p/p_0)} = \frac{1}{n_{m} C} + \frac{C - 1}{n_{m} C}(p/p_0)

    If we plot the isotherm points as :math:`\frac{p/p_0}{n_{ads}(1-p/p_0)}` versus
    :math:`p/p_0`, a linear region can usually be found. The slope and intercept of this line
    can then be used to calculate :math:`n_{m}`, the amount adsorbed at the statistical
    monolayer, as well as :math:`C`, the BET constant.

    .. math::

        n_{m} = \frac{1}{s+i}

        C = \frac{s}{i} + 1

    The surface area can then be calculated by using the moles adsorbed at the statistical
    monolayer. If the specific area taken by one of the adsorbate molecules on the surface
    is known, it is inserted in the following equation together with Avogadro's number:

    .. math::

        a_{BET} = n_m A_N \sigma


    *Limitations*

    While a standard for surface area determinations, the BET area should be
    used with care, as there are many assumptions made in the calculation. To
    augment the validity of the BET method, Rouquerol [#]_ proposed several
    checks to ensure that the BET region selected is valid:

    * The BET constant (:math:`C`) obtained should be positive.
    * In the corresponding Rouquerol plot where :math:`n_{ads}(1-p/p_0)` is plotted
      with respect to :math:`p/p_0`, the points chosen for BET analysis should be
      strictly increasing.
    * The loading at the statistical monolayer should be situated within the
      limits of the BET region.

    This module implements all these checks.

    Regardless, the BET surface area should still be interpreted carefully. The following
    assumptions are implicitly made in this approach:

    * Adsorption takes place on the pore surface. Microporous materials which have pores
      in similar size as the molecule adsorbed cannot posses a realistic surface area.
    * The cross-sectional area of the molecule on the surface cannot be guaranteed
      For example, nitrogen has been known to adopt different orientations on the
      surface of some materials due to inter-molecular forces, which effectively
      lowers its cross-sectional area.
    * No account is made for heterogeneous adsorbate-adsorbent interaction in the BET theory.
