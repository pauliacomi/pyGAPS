    Calculate the isosteric enthalpy of adsorption (in kJ/mol) by applying
    Clausius-Clapeyron equation to several isotherms recorded at different
    temperatures on the same material.

    Parameters
    ----------
    isotherms : list[PointIsotherms | ModelIsotherm]
        The isotherms to use in calculation of the isosteric enthalpy. They should all
        be measured on the same material.
    loading_points : list[float], optional
        The loading points at which the isosteric enthalpy should be calculated.
        Default will be 50 equally spaced points in the available range.
        The points must be within the range of loading of all passed isotherms, or
        else the calculation cannot complete.
    branch : str
        The branch of the isotherms to take, defaults to adsorption branch.
    verbose : bool
        Whether to print out extra information and generate a graph.

    Returns
    -------
    result_dict : dict
        A dictionary with the isosteric enthalpies per loading, with the form:

        - ``isosteric_enthalpy`` (array) : the isosteric enthalpy of adsorption in kJ/mol
        - ``loading`` (array) : the loading for each point of the isosteric enthalpy, in mmol
        - ``slopes`` (array) : the exact log(p) vs 1/T slope for each point
        - ``correlation`` (array) : correlation coefficient for each point
        - ``std_errors`` (array) : estimated standard errors for each point

    Raises
    ------
    ParameterError
        When something is wrong with the function parameters.

    Notes
    -----
    *Description*

    The isosteric enthalpies are calculated from experimental data using the Clausius-Clapeyron
    equation as the starting point:

    .. math::

        \Big( \frac{\partial \ln P}{\partial T} \Big)_{n_a} = -\frac{\Delta H_{ads}}{R T^2}

    Where :math:`\Delta H_{ads}` is the enthalpy of adsorption. In order to approximate the
    partial differential, two or more isotherms are measured at different temperatures. The
    assumption made is that the enthalpy of adsorption does not vary in the temperature range
    chosen. Therefore, the isosteric enthalpy of adsorption can be calculated by using the pressures
    at which the loading is identical using the following equation for each point:

    .. math::

        \Delta H_{ads} = - R \frac{\partial \ln P}{\partial 1 / T}

    and plotting the values of :math:`\ln P` against :math:`1 / T` we should obtain a straight
    line with a slope of :math:`- \Delta H_{ads} / R.`

    *Limitations*

    The isosteric enthalpy is sensitive to the differences in pressure between
    the two isotherms. If the isotherms measured are too close together, the
    error margin will increase.

    The method also assumes that enthalpy of adsorption does not vary with
    temperature. If the variation is large for the system in question, the
    isosteric enthalpy calculation will give unrealistic values.

    Even with carefully measured experimental data, there are two assumptions
    used in deriving the Clausius-Clapeyron equation: an ideal bulk gas phase
    and a negligible adsorbed phase molar volume. These have a significant
    effect on the calculated isosteric enthalpies of adsorption, especially at
    high relative pressures and for heavy adsorbates.
