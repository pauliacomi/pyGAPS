    Calculate surface area and pore volume using a t-plot.

    The ``thickness_model`` parameter is a string which names the thickness
    equation which should be used. Alternatively, a user can implement their own
    thickness model, either as an Isotherm or a function which describes the
    adsorbed layer. In that case, instead of a string, pass the Isotherm object
    or the callable function as the ``thickness_model`` parameter. The
    ``t_limits`` specifies the upper and lower limits of the thickness section
    which should be taken for analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    isotherm : PointIsotherm, ModelIsotherm
        The isotherm of which to calculate the t-plot parameters.
    thickness_model : str, PointIsotherm, ModelIsotherm, `callable`, optional
        Name of the thickness model to use. Defaults to the Harkins and Jura
        thickness curve.
    branch : {'ads', 'des'}, optional
        Branch of the isotherm to use. It defaults to adsorption.
    t_limits : tuple[float, float], optional
        Thickness range in which to perform the calculation.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Prints extra information and plots graphs of the calculation.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary containing the t-plot curve, as well as a list of dictionaries
        with calculated parameters for each straight section. The basis of these
        results will be derived from the basis of the isotherm (per mass or per
        volume of adsorbent):

        - ``thickness curve`` (list) : Calculated thickness curve
        - ``results`` (list of dicts):

          - ``section`` (array) : the points of the plot chosen for the line
          - ``area`` (float) : calculated surface area, from the section parameters
          - ``adsorbed_volume`` (float) : the amount adsorbed in the pores as calculated per section
          - ``slope`` (float) : slope of the straight trendline fixed through the region
          - ``intercept`` (float) : intercept of the straight trendline through the region
          - ``corr_coef`` (float) : correlation coefficient of the linear region

    Raises
    ------
    ParameterError
        When something is wrong with the function parameters.
    CalculationError
        When the calculation itself fails.

    Notes
    -----
    *Description*

    The t-plot method [#]_ attempts to relate the adsorption on a material with an ideal
    curve which describes the thickness of the adsorbed layer on a surface. A plot is
    constructed, where the isotherm loading data is plotted versus thickness values obtained
    through the model.

    It stands to reason that, in the case that the experimental adsorption curve follows
    the model, a straight line will be obtained with its intercept through the origin.
    However, since in most cases there are differences between adsorption in the pores
    and ideal surface adsorption, the t-plot will deviate and form features which can
    be analysed to describe the material characteristics.

    - a sharp vertical deviation will indicate condensation in a type of pore
    - a gradual slope will indicate adsorption on the wall of a particular pore

    The slope of the linear section can be used to calculate the area where the adsorption
    is taking place. If it is of a linear region at the start of the curve, it will represent
    the total surface area of the material. If at the end of the curve, it will instead
    represent external surface area of the material. The formula to calculate the area is:

    .. math::

        A = \frac{s M_m}{\rho_{l}}

    where :math:`\rho_{l}` is the liquid density of the adsorbate at experimental
    conditions

    If the region selected is after a vertical deviation, the intercept of the line
    will no longer pass through the origin. This intercept be used to calculate the
    pore volume through the following equation:

    .. math::

        V_{ads} = \frac{i M_m}{\rho_{l}}


    *Limitations*

    Since the t-plot method is observing the differences between the isotherm
    and an ideal adsorption curve, care must be taken to ensure that the model
    actually describes the thickness of a layer of adsorbate on the surface of
    the adsorbent. This is more difficult than it appears as no universal
    thickness curve exists. When selecting a thickness model, make sure that it
    is applicable to both the material and the adsorbate. Interactions at
    loadings that occur on the t-plot lower than the monolayer thickness do not
    have any physical meaning.

    A second notable caveat is that the geometry of the pore will change the
    packing of the molecules, therefore the total thickness. Therefore, at
    smaller pores (<10 x the size of the guest molecule)
