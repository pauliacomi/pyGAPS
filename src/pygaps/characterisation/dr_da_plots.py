    r"""
    Calculate pore volume and effective adsorption potential
    through a Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) plot.

    The optional ``p_limits`` parameter allows to specify the upper and lower
    pressure limits for the calculation, otherwise the entire range will be
    used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    isotherm : PointIsotherm, ModelIsotherm
        The isotherm to use for the DR plot.
    branch : {'ads', 'des'}, optional
        Branch of the isotherm to use. It defaults to adsorption.
    p_limits : [float, float], optional
        Pressure range in which to perform the calculation.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Prints extra information and plots the resulting fit graph.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Dictionary of results with the following parameters:

        - ``pore_volume`` (float) : calculated total micropore volume, cm3/material unit
        - ``adsorption_potential`` (float) : calculated adsorption potential, in kJ/mol

    Raises
    ------
    ParameterError
        When something is wrong with the function parameters.
    CalculationError
        When the calculation itself fails.

    Notes
    -----
    The Dubinin-Radushkevich equation [#]_ is an extension of the
    potential theory of Polanyi, which asserts that molecules
    near a surface are subjected to a potential field.
    The adsorbate at the surface is in a liquid state and
    its local pressure is conversely equal to the vapour pressure
    at the adsorption temperature.

    Pore filling progresses as a function of total adsorbed volume :math:`V_{t}`.

    .. math::

        V_{ads} = V_{t} \exp\Big[\Big(\frac{\Delta G}{\varepsilon}\Big)^{2}\Big]

    Here :math:`\Delta G` is the change in Gibbs free energy
    :math:`\Delta G = - RT \ln(p_0/p)` and :math:`\varepsilon`
    is a characteristic energy of adsorption. Substituting:

    .. math::

        V_{ads} = V_{t} - e^{-\Big(\frac{RT}{\varepsilon}\Big)^2 \ln^2{\frac{p_0}{p}}} = V_{t} - e^{-D \ln^2{\frac{p_0}{p}}}

    If an experimental isotherm is consistent with the DR model,
    the equation can be used to obtain the total pore volume
    and energy of adsorption. The DR equation is linearised:

    .. math::

        \ln{V_{ads}} = \ln{V_{t}} - \Big(\frac{RT}{\varepsilon}\Big)^2 \ln^2{\Big[\frac{p_0}{p}}\Big]

    Isotherm loading is converted to volume adsorbed by
    assuming that the density of the adsorbed phase is equal to
    bulk liquid density at the isotherm temperature.
    Afterwards :math:`\ln{V_{ads}}` is plotted
    against :math:`\ln^2{p_0/p}`,
    and fitted with a best-fit line. The intercept of this
    line can be used to calculate the total pore volume,
    while the slope is proportional to the characteristic
    energy of adsorption :math:`\varepsilon`.

    Notes

    The Dubinin-Astakov equation [#]_ is an expanded form
    of the Dubinin-Radushkevich model. It is an extension of the
    potential theory of Polanyi, which asserts that molecules
    near a surface are subjected to a potential field.
    The adsorbate at the surface is in a liquid state and
    its local pressure is conversely equal to the vapour pressure
    at the adsorption temperature.

    Pore filling progresses as a function of total adsorbed volume :math:`V_{t}`.

    .. math::

        V_{ads} = V_{t} \exp\Big[\Big(\frac{\Delta G}{\varepsilon}\Big)^{n}\Big]

    Here :math:`\Delta G` is the change in Gibbs free energy
    :math:`\Delta G = - RT \ln(p_0/p)` and :math:`\varepsilon`
    is a characteristic energy of adsorption.
    The exponent :math:`n` is a fitting coefficient, often taken between
    1 (described as surface adsorption) and 3 (micropore adsorption).
    The exponent can also be related to surface heterogeneity.  Substituting:

    .. math::

        V_{ads} = V_{t} - e^{-\Big(\frac{RT}{\varepsilon}\Big)^n \ln^n{\frac{p_0}{p}}} = V_{t} - e^{-D \ln^n{\frac{p_0}{p}}}

    If an experimental isotherm is consistent with the DA model,
    the equation can be used to obtain the total pore volume
    and energy of adsorption. The DA equation is first linearised:

    .. math::

        \ln{V_{ads}} = \ln{V_{t}} - \Big(\frac{RT}{\varepsilon}\Big)^n \ln^n{\Big[\frac{p_0}{p}}\Big]

    Isotherm loading is converted to volume adsorbed by
    assuming that the density of the adsorbed phase is equal to
    bulk liquid density at the isotherm temperature.
    Afterwards :math:`\ln{V_{ads}}` is plotted
    against :math:`\ln^n{p_0/p}`,
    and fitted with a best-fit line. The intercept of this
    line can be used to calculate the total pore volume,
    while the slope is proportional to the characteristic
    energy of adsorption :math:`\varepsilon`.
