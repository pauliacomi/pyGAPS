"""
Tests relating to thickness model validation.

All functions in /calculations/models_thickness.py are tested here.
The purposes are:

    - testing the output of the thickness functions
    - testing that the "function getter" is performing as expected.

The thickness functions are tested against pre-calculated values
at several points.
