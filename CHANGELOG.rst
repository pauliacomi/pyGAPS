------------------

* AIF can read/write all isotherm types (models/points).
  Also further improved parsing of units and metadata.
* Quantachrome `txt` files are now fully parseable
* Isotherm data can now be other things beside numbers.
* Added two standard isotherms (silica+carbon black). Can be used in thickness calculations.

4.2.0 (2022-06-29)
------------------

* Better error handling of nonphysical mesoporous PSD models
* CLI now prints package version with `--version` argument

4.1.1 (2022-03-10)
------------------

Fixes:

* AIF file export now more reliable with custom properties
* Isotherm models correctly instantiate their variables (parameters would
  otherwise be shared between instances)

4.1.0 (2022-03-02)
------------------

New features:

* üêç Minimum python reduced to 3.6 to increase compatibility.
* üéÜ pyGAPS is now (actually) on ``conda-forge``.

4.0.0 (2022-02-23)
------------------

New features:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è To reduce import bloat pyGAPS is now **modular**. Previously global
  functions must be accessed through submodules. For example:
  ``pygaps.area_BET`` now must be imported from
  ``pygaps.characterisation.area_BET``.
* üéÜ pyGAPS is now on ``conda-forge``
* Volumetric adsorbed amount is now given in either ``volume_gas`` or
  `volume_liquid` basis, corresponding to the volume amount the adsorbate would
  occupy in the bulk gas phase, or the volume of an ideal liquid phase of
  adsorbate (at isotherm temperature). The old loading_basis of ``volume`` is
  deprecated and automatically converted to ``volume_gas`` while emitting a
  warning.
* Manufacturer parsing is streamlined with the introduction of the
  ``pygaps.parsing.isotherm_from_commercial`` function.
* Drastically improved reliability and modularity of code in preparation
  for the release of the pyGAPS-gui interface.
* Added a "zero" thickness model that assumes no mono/multilayer sorption.
  Useful in the case of condensation in hydrophobic materials.
* Better documentation.

Changes:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Minimum python is now 3.7, maximum increased to 3.10.
* Removed the need to pass DataFrame column names with the ``other_keys``
  syntax. PointIsotherms, now save *all* passed DataFrame columns.
* Smart assigning of isotherm metadata caused confusion and was removed.
  Metadata assigned like ``isotherm.myparam`` is now no longer serialized to
  dictionaries, parsers etc. Instead, isotherms have a `isotherm.properties`
  dictionary which contains all metadata.
* Adsorption/desorption branches are internally represented as 0 and 1 instead
  of False/True. This allows the possibility for further cycles to be introduced
  in a future release.
* Isotherm ``material`` and ``adsorbate`` are now always instantiated as
  ``pygaps.Material`` and ``pygaps.Adsorbate`` classes.

Plus many small and large bugs fixed.

3.1.0 (2021-04-22)
------------------

New features:

* pyGAPS is now capable of parsing to and from Adsorption Information Files
  (AIF). For more info, see *Evans, Jack D., Volodymyr Bon, Irena Senkovska, and
  Stefan Kaskel. ‚ÄòA Universal Standard Archive File for Adsorption Data‚Äô.
  Langmuir, 2 April 2021, DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c00122.*


3.0.0 (2021-03-14)
------------------

New features:

* The internal Adsorbate list now contains over 170 analytes, 81 of which have a
  correspondence in the thermodynamic backend. This includes multiple vapours,
  VOCs, and refrigerants.
* Added new mode for pressure as "relative%", which represents relative pressure
  as a percentage rather than a fraction (i.e. p/p0 * 100).
* Added two new modes for loading as "fraction" and "percent". This ties the
  uptake to the same basis as the adsorbate (i.e. weight%, volume%, mol% or
  fractions thereof).
* Conversely, NIST format isotherms based on "wt%" can also be converted.
* Significant improvements to the Horvath-Kawazoe methods of pore size
  distribution, including more pore geometries (cylindrical and spherical
  through the Saito-Foley and Cheng-Yang modifications) and the inclusion of
  extended HK models, with the Cheng-Yang and Rege-Yang corrections.
* Command-line interface: a CLI entry point is automatically added during pyGAPS
  installation and can be called with ``pygaps -h`` to perform some simple
  commands.
* Isotherm JSON parser (``pygaps.isotherm_to_json``) now passes all extra
  parameters to the ``json.dump`` function.
* Perform isotherm branch separation based on maximum pressure, rather than
  first derivative. In such way, slight uncertainty in pressures won't lead to a
  wrong assignment.
* The reference area for an alpha_s calculation can now be specified as either
  "BET" or "Langmuir".
* Convenience function `isotherm.convert()` which combines all isotherm
  conversion modes.
* Convenience function `pygaps.model_iso()` which fits a model to a
  PointIsotherm, effectively wrapping `ModelIsotherm.from_pointisotherm`.
* Convenience functions for isotherm parsing: `isotherm.to_json()`,
  `isotherm.to_csv()` and `isotherm.to_xl()`.
* Parsing from instrument output files now gets more information.
* Plot quality has been overall improved.
* Improved performance for isotherm conversions.
* General refactoring and speed-ups.
* Switched to GitHub actions for CI, now MacOS builds are also tested.

Breaking changes:

* Included Python 3.8 and deprecated Python 3.5.
* All parameters like ``adsorbate_basis`` or ``adsorbate_unit`` have been
  changed to ``material_basis`` and ``material_unit`` for consistency. Old
  format should still work for some time.
* Some model names have been changed to include only ASCII: ``JensenSeaton``,
  ``FHVST``, ``WVST``.
* For isotherm pressure/loading, a `limits` tuple is now passed instead of
  `min_range` and `max_range`, as for other functions in pyGAPS.
* JSON ModelIsotherms now have ``name`` instead of ``model`` as the model name.
  This is now consistent with both CSV and Excel.
* The `isotherm_to_jsonf` and `isotherm_from_jsonf` functions have been removed.
  Functionality has been merged with `isotherm_to_json` similarly to the `pandas
  model
  <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_json.html>`_.
* Removed the `util_get_file_paths` function.

Fixes:

* Volumetric -> molar conversions were not calculated correctly.
* Isosteric enthalpy could not be calculated if the isotherm was not in mmol/g.
* ModelIsotherm creation could in some cases ignore isotherm branch splitting.
* BET area now attempts to pick at least 3 points if physically consistent.
  Should stop failing on some isotherms.
* BET/Langmuir area maximum calculation was offset by one point.
* The "section" returned in tplot/alphas is now consistent for both manual and
  automatic limits: a list indices for selected points

2.0.2 (2019-12-18)
------------------

New features:

* Added fluids to database: n-pentane, n-hexane, n-octane, o-xylene, m-xylene,
  p-xylene, cyclohexane, hydrogen sulphide and sulphur hexafluoride.

Fixes:

* Converting Adsorbates to a dictionary now correctly outputs the list of
  aliases.
* Changed stored critical point molar mass values for some adsorbates.

2.0.1 (2019-07-08)
------------------

* Fixed error in dft kernel acquisition.
* Removed duplicate plot generation from virial initial henry.
* Fixed Appveyor testing.

1.6.0 (2019-05-08)
------------------

New features:

* Added a function to get isotherms from the NIST ISODB,
  ``pygaps.load_nist_isotherm`` which takes the ISODB filename
  as an argument.
* Added hexane as an adsorbate in the database.
* Isotherm adsorbate is now a pygaps.Adsorbate object and
  can be accessed directly for all attributes
  (only when available in the internal database, otherwise still a string).
* ModelIsotherms can now be saved and imported from JSON, CSV and Excel.
* Added a ``marker`` option to the ``plot_iso`` function
  which acts similar to the ``color`` parameter and allows
  simple selection of the marker style.

  as well as more thorough testing
* Isotherm modelling backend is now more robust.

------------------

New features:

* Increased number of adsorbates available in pyGAPS to 40.
* New material characterisation functions: Dubinin-Radushkevich
  (dr_plot) and Dubinin-Astakov (da_plot) plots.
* Added a new way to create an isotherm, from an two arrays of pressure
  and loading (the old DataFrame method is still valid but changed:
  check breaking changes).
* Made adsorbates searchable by a list of aliases rather than a single name.
* Exposed the CoolProp backend on adsorbate objects for convenience, it is
  accessible through the adsorbate.backend property.
* Streamlined the internal database functions.
* Updated NIST json import to new format.
  Cannot import multicomponent isotherms.

  (similar to behaviour of pandas) to plot on existing figures.
* Changed behaviour of ModelIsotherm.guess function to accept a list of
  models to attempt to guess for.
* Added b-spline smoothing to output of dft fitting.

Breaking changes:

* The Sample class is now renamed as Material.
* Isotherm creation parameters have changed from 'sample_name', 'sample_batch'
  and 't_exp' to 'material_name', 'material_batch' and 't_iso'.
* Backend database has been simplified. Many required fields are no longer
  present and left to the discretion of the user.
* Several database functions have been renamed.
  All functions switched: 'sample' -> 'material' and 'experiment' -> 'isotherm'.
* When passing a DataFrame for isotherm creation, it now has to be specified as
  the parameter 'isotherm_data'.
* Isotherm unique ID is now generated on the fly (previously generated at
  each isotherm modification). It also now takes into account only the
  required parameters for each isotherm ( 'sample_name', 'sample_batch',
  't_exp' and 'adsorbate') as well as the model name, if the
  isotherm is a ModelIsotherm.
* Renamed Adsorbate.from_list() method to Adsorbate.find()

Bugfixes:

* Fixed issue in CSV import which read all values as strings (instead of floats/bools)
* Fixed an issue with Excel import of bools, as they were previously read as 1/0
* Fixed a bug where the automatic branch detection was not working when the
  DataFrame passed had a non-standard index.
* Fixed not being able to call _repr_ on an isotherm.

1.3.0 (2018-08-13)
------------------

New features:

* Added an excel import which can take Micromeritics or
  Belsorp report (.xls) files. Micromeritics code was
  taken from the `official python repo <https://github.com/Micromeritics/micromeritics>`_.
* Added an import option which can read and import Belsorp
  data (.DAT) files.
* Improved plotting functions to allow for more customisation
  over how the graph looks.
* The extra arguments to print_info() are now passed to the plotting
  function allowing for styles such as :issue:`8`.

Breaking changes:

* The unique isotherm ID is now generated only on a small subset of
  properties instead of all isotherm properties.
* The isotherm 'other_properties' subdictionary has been removed.
  Instead, all isotherm properties are now direct members of the
  class.
* When plotting, isotherm branches are now defined as 'ads', 'des'
  'all' (both branches) and 'all-nol' (both branches without
  legend entry) instead of a list of branches.
* Plot types are now universal. Any property can be plotted
  against any other property by specifying the x_data,
  y1_data and y2_data.
